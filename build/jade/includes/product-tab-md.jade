              li Our 10-year warranty is at least twice as long as any of our competitors.
              li The DeltaPValve is the only control valve with 3 P/T ports, which are vital to confirm system pressures, pressure independent operation, and shutoff.
              li We offer the largest differential pressure operating range (5-70 PSID or 10-90 PSID) to simplify selection and ensure stable operation.
              li Our valves are individually built and tested in Woodinville, WA, USA to ensure product quality and reliability and meet ARRA and Buy American requirements.

              li 100:1 turndown enables control of flow throughout the full range of the valve.
              li We are the only valve manufacturers to offer a delta T guarantee. 
              li The DeltaPValve has the ability to maintain +/- 0.1° F LAT control
              li DeltaPValves are factory set for design flow, reducing staff requirements and allowing more time for preventative maintenance
