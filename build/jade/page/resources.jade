As the inventors of pressure independent technology and industry leaders in performance, precision control and durability, Flow Control Industries has defined pressure independence as maximum of ±5% allowable deviation of total flow from setpoint.  While nearly all other manufacturers of “pressure independent” valves claim to meet or exceed this specification, third party testing data clearly shows that the DeltaPValve is the only one to perform as advertised.', '../resources/DefiningPressureIndependence-Accuracy.pdf')

System configurations have evolved over the years in an attempt to save energy and increase performance. In this paper several different system configurations were modeled to predict the electrical cost and savings comparison of chilled water pumps. Additionally, typical control valves are compared to pressure independent DeltaPValves that are proven to increase delta T, decrease flow, and decrease pumping demands.', '../resources/Whitepaper-Pumping-Configurations-DeltaPValve-Savings.pdf')

A DeltaPValve® System, using DeltaPValves as manufactured by Flow Control Industries, is revolutionary, changing the way HVAC systems are designed and operated. By establishing unprecedented system stability, the benefits of precision control extend throughout the HVAC system resulting in substantial energy savings as high as 40%.

              .whitepapers__text.animate-40 The three P/T ports on all DeltaPValves are an easily accessible feature to quickly confirm pressure independence and valve operation, or diagnose flow concerns. A handheld manometer is a basic tool that every installer, inspector or maintenance manager should have available during integration to manually check pressure readings to verify performance and sensor accuracy. While there are a number of manufacturers that provide acceptable manometers, Flow Control Industries typically utilizes the Dwyer model 490-4 for Wet/Wet 0-100 PSID service. FCI will be happy to assist in selecting and ordering new manometers.
